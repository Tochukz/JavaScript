__The Dangers of Variable Scoping__  
Any `var` declared within a function is scoped to that function, even if it is defined within a block in the function. Combining this with variable hosting further muddies the waters.  

__let__   
_vars_ do not respect block scope. ES6 introduced block scope for variables declared using the _let_ keyword.    
Variables defined using the let keyword will be scoped within the closes enclosing block. We can also say they are lexically scoped to the closest enclosing block.

__const__   
Other than the fact that _const_ cannot be reassigned, everthing ablut _let_ applies to _const_ as well.  

__Summary__  
_let_ and _const_ give us everything we need, with the appropriate checks baked into the runtime.
