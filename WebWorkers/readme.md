__Multithreaded Programs in JavaScript__  
# Web Workers (2012) 
__By Ido Green__  

### Preface 
Web Workers allows you to run JavaScript in a separate thread that doesn't interfere with the user interface of your web application.   
Like threads in other technologies, Web Workers are relatively heavyweight. You donâ€™t want to use them in large numbers, as each one consumes significant system resources.

## Chapter 1: Overview
The Web Worker specification defined an API for running computationally intensive code in a thread other than the web application user interface.  

If you web application needs to complete a task that takes more than 150 milliseconds, you should consider using a Web Worker. 

__What Web Workers Can and Can't Do__   
Workers cannot access the DOM of the parent page, so they can not access the   
* _window_ object
* _document_ object
* _parent_ object

As a result they cannot use JavaScript Libraries that depend on these object like _jQuery_.  

Web Workers can access 
* _navigator_ object
* _location_ object 
* _XMLHTTPRequest_ function 
* _setTimout_ _clearTimeout_, _setINterval_ and _clearInterval()_ functions
*  _importScripts()_ method
* _atob()_  and _btoa()_ functions  

_atob()_  and _btoa()_ functions are for conversion between Base 64 ASCII and binary data. 

__Types of Web Wokers__   
Based on their execution style,ther are two types  
1. _Long-running workrer_: The register an _nmessage_ event handler and keep listening for new messages. They run in the baxckground continuously and do not exit.  
2. _Single tasked worker_: The never register an _onmessage_ event handler. The run a single task and exit once the operation is done.  

## Chapter 2: How and Where Can We Use Web Workers?   
Use web worker to load data from external source and work with it:  
```
 importScripts('http://example.com?callBack=handleWorkerResults');
 function handleWorkerResults() {
  postMessage(result);
 }
```
I still need to figure out how to make this work.
